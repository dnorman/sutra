# sutra

[![CI](https://github.com/dnorman/sutra/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dnorman/sutra/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A dev environment status dashboard. Monitors a well-known state folder for environment meta and per-unit status files, rendering everything in a native GUI (iced) or TUI (ratatui). On macOS, state transitions trigger system sounds, speech, and native notifications.

## Install

```sh
cargo install sutra
```

## Usage

```sh
sutra                       # launch GUI (backgrounds by default)
sutra mon --foreground      # GUI, attached to terminal
sutra mon --tui             # terminal UI
```

Both interfaces support per-unit and global toggles for sound and notification muting, environment termination, and opening browser ports.

## Platform support

|---|---|---|
| GUI (iced) | yes | yes |
